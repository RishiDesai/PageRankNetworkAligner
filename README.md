# PageRankNetworkAligner

I created a PageRank-based network alignment generator as my final project in CS 106X (Fall 2019, Prof. Jerry Cain). I used protein-protein interaction networks from BioGRID (v3.2.101, June 2013) [1] as test data. I used Edge Coverage (EC), Symmetric Substructure Score (S3), and Node Correctness (NC) to evalulate my algorithm. My poster presentation contains the background, implementation details, and performance results of the algorithm.
