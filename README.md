# PageRank Network Aligner

I created a PageRank-based network alignment algorithm for my final project in CS 106X (Fall 2019, Prof. Jerry Cain). I used protein-protein interaction networks from the BioGRID (v3.2.101, June 2013) [1] dataset. I used Edge Coverage (EC), Symmetric Substructure Score (S3) [2], and Node Correctness (NC) to evalulate my algorithm. My poster presentation contains the background, implementation details, and evaluation of the algorithm.
